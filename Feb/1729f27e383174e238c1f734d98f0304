The 13th Annual GYEO Summit theme is The Opportunity Puzzle: Piecing It Together for All Youth To Learn, Earn, and Thrive. This theme builds on the learning outcomes of our 2017-2018 focus on the changing world of work for youth in developing contexts, linking insights on the technological and structural changes that characterize the changing world of work to the broader systems that impact young peoples’ lives.
