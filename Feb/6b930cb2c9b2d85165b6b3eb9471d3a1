The Enabling the Business of Agriculture (EBA) Online Learning Module Series is now available as a self-paced training program. The training includes an overview as well as more targeted modules that explore aspects of trade and finance. Participants will learn about the World Bank’s Enabling the Business of Agriculture Index and how that data can be used to support programs that further the U.S. Government’s Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS) goals. The Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Food Security (EEFS) project developed this content with funding from the USAID Bureau for Food Security Office of Market and Partnership Innovations.
