As the Feed the Future Knowledge-Driven Agricultural Development (KDAD) project winds down after more than five years, we have acquired knowledge that we feel has value to the development and food security communities writ large. Although we’ve been fortunate to receive a six-month extension allowing us to continue our work through March 2019, we'd like to share KDAD's End of Project Report now. Our report communicates highlights, accomplishments — and in true learning fashion — some of the challenges inherent when working in a multi-stakeholder international development environment. Living our values of sustainable knowledge sharing, we have re-purposed a Feed the Future microsite for the End of Project Report. On the site, you will also find a PDF of the full version of the document along with select learning reports, expanding the information available for those interested in going further. It’s been a great five years, and we’ve enjoyed connecting with all of you via Agrilinks and the other platforms, events and products KDAD has supported in partnership with USAID.
