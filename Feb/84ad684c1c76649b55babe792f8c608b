Recent research commissioned by the USAID Center for Resilience and conducted by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) examined why some households escape and remain out of poverty (sustainable poverty escape), while other households escape only to fall back into poverty (transitory poverty escape), and still others descend into poverty for the first time (impoverishment). The below findings developed by the USAID Center for Resilience represent a few common patterns found in the research across the Asian countries studied: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal and the Philippines.
