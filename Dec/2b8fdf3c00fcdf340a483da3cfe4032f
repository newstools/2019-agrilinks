The SAWBO animation, “How to Identify and Scout for Fall Armyworm” is currently available in more than 30 languages and in two versions – one for Africa and another one for the Indian sub-continent. But how did it all begin? Dr. Abdurahman Beshir, Seed Systems Lead for USAID’s Feed the Future Nepal Seed and Fertilizer Project in Nepal explains how USAID funded and participated in a collaboration between the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and SAWBO resulted in the animation that has been viewed by over 1 million in Nepal. The animation’s success has led to translation into more languages currently in progress and continues to evolve to reach greater audiences in the fight against FAW.
