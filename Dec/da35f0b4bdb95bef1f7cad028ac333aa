The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock systems develops innovative solutions to problems with livestock production and animal-source food consumption. Here are five one-page fact sheets about innovations that were developed for the prevention and control of livestock diseases. Each innovation is based on active or recently completed research projects we funded in the respective country. They are widely applicable for smallholder farmers and stakeholders across the developing world. Each fact sheet provides a summary, quick facts, and an application of the innovation. These PDF pages may be printed or shared electronically. Citations of Innovation Summaries Management Entity. June 2019.
