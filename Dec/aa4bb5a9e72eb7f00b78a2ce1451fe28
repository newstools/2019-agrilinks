This post is written by Meng Zeng, FAO. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) appreciates and uses digital tools and technology to create an enabling environment for innovation and to enhance access of stakeholders, especially smallholders and family farmers, to apply innovative solutions. The introduction of digital agriculture has the potential to make agriculture more productive, resilient and inclusive by saving time and using resources more efficiently and effectively. Digital agriculture presents a new pathway to upgrade food systems and value chains. Digital agriculture has the potential to transform the agri-food sector to increase efficiency and ensure sustainability and food security. It also enhances the capacity of smallholder farmers through digital innovations and other emerging technologies (such as blockchain, AI and ML). FAO’s approach, so far, can be conceptualized in the five-pillar approach on digital agriculture transformation.
