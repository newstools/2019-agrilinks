Are you looking for research evidence on international development? You’re in luck. USAID's online repository, the Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC), a free, publicly available, and searchable database, recently added a list of more than 15,700 USAID-funded and USAID-affiliated peer-reviewed research publications to its collection.  Maybe you are interested in reading about USAID-supported research related to nutrition and agriculture. Perhaps you want to learn about drought-resistant crop strains. Simply click the link above and type in your search terms. You could also search by country or region to see research evidence for specific geographic areas, produced through USAID support. USAID is committed to increasing public access and usability of USAID-funded data and research evidence, in compliance with the Foundations of Evidence-based Policymaking Act and the Public Access Plan. Now, anyone can more easily find USAID-funded research evidence to draw on to inform future development policies and programming. The addition of this collection to the DEC is an example of the Agency’s commitment to increasing public access and usability of USAID-funded data and research. We are thrilled to be able to provide improved access to these USAID-supported research publications. The successful publication of these journal articles is a testament to the variety and quality of USAID-supported research, including locally-generated research, supporting many countries’ journeys to self-reliance.
