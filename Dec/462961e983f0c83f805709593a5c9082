Marketlinks recently published a blog series in partnership with DAI Global's Dan Langfitt that highlights a partnership facility from the USAID Feed the Future Agricultural Innovations activity* (FTF Inova). This series explores how a partnership facility can work as an interface between donor-funded programs and their private-sector partners, and how the partnerships that emerge can be an engine driving systemic change.

Check out the links below to read the blogs in the series and learn more about partnership facilities.  Why Build a Partnership Facility in the First Place?
In the first post of the series, we discuss why FTF Inova created a partnership facility to design good partnerships. We also share a case study about capturing systemic change in Bangladesh from the USAID Bangladesh Agriculture Value Chains (AVC) project. How Do We Do Partnerships in Practice?
In part two, we discuss how the partnership facility, our tools, and our processes create a space for more effective collaboration with the private sector. What Has (and Hasn’t) Our Partnership Facility Done for Us?
Part three explores what we learned since we began using the first complete iteration of our partnership facility. We also share some of the adaptations we have in mind for the next two years. What Can a Good Partnership Facility Do for an MSD Program?
In the last post of the series, we recall how broad the term “partnership facility” is, and we reflect on the trade-offs market systems development programs should consider when designing a partnership facility. *The Feed the Future Agricultural Innovations activity (FTF Inova) is a five-year, $21M market systems development activity funded by USAID and implemented in Mozambique since 2017 by DAI with support from Technoserve, MarketShare Associates, and EcoVentures International.  For more information, see the following page on DAI’s website.
