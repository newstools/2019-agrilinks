For smallholder cocoa farmers in Central America, geographic isolation makes it difficult to learn how to grow quality cocoa. Now, with Cacao Movil (Mobile Cocoa), a open-source mobile app designed by Lutheran World Relief, cocoa farmers have the technical expertise they need right at their fingertips. The app’s 10 practical guides include information on cocoa cultivation and covers subjects ranging from soil management, pruning techniques, pest management, and a primer on cocoa marketing. Cacao Movil is freely available through cacaomovil.com or Google Play. The development of Cacao Movil was funded by the U.S. Department of State and the World Environment Center’s Pathways Innovation Challenge. Lutheran World Relief was one of four winners among 600 applicants chosen to receive the funding, designated for the most innovative and successful models for strengthening and expanding small-medium enterprises in Latin America.
