IDEAL is pleased to announce the release of the first RFA through its Small Grants Program!  

With generous support from USAID’s Office of Food for Peace, we are inviting emergency and development organizations to apply for Micro Grant awards up to $50,000. In this first round of Micro Grants, we expect to award more than a dozen grants to eligible organizations of all sizes around the world. These Fixed Amount Awards (FAAs) can help develop tools, conduct topic-specific learning events, or fund practical field-level approaches that address capacity and knowledge gaps in food and nutrition security programming in emergency and development contexts.  

When is the deadline for applications?
Applications we will be reviewed and scored in two rounds starting on the dates below. If an application is submitted after the first round cut off, your application will be considered in the second round of reviews: For more details about this request for applications, please refer to the documents below: IDEAL Micro Grant Request for Applications (RFA) Attachment 1: Application Template Attachment 2: Detailed Budget Template Attachment 3: Budget Narrative Attachment 4: USAID Standard Provisions for FAAs for NGOs
