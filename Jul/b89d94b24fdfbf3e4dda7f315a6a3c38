Climate Services for Resilient Development (CSRD) is a USAID-supported global partnership that connects climate and environmental science with data streams to generate decision support tools and training for decision-makers in developing countries. The CSRD consortium in South Asia is led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, which works closely with the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and Bangladesh Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), among other international partners. Through this partnership IRI worked with with CIMMYT to bring BMD and DAE staff to Columbia University for intensive training and collaboration on climate services in Bangladesh. In addition to the CSRD support, curriculum development and some sessions for the training were supported by Adapting Agriculture to Climate Today, for Tomorrow (ACToday), a Columbia World Project.
