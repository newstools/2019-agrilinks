The USAID Food for Peace-funded SCALE and PRO-WASH awards are currently conducting a survey to better understand the opportunities and challenges facing implementing partners in emergency and development contexts.* Your responses to this survey will inform how we can support and engage with partners like you. Take a few minutes to add your voice! 

Note that this survey is available in English, French, and Arabic. Please complete the survey before July 31st.

 *If you are part of a DFSA and participated in interviews as part of the PRO-WASH desk mapping, your responses have been taken into consideration and there is no need to complete the WASH-related questions in the survey.
