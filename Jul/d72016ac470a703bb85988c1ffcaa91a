The USAID Office of Food for Peace (FFP)-funded Strengthening Capacity in Agriculture, Livelihoods and Environment (SCALE) and Practices, Research and Operations in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (PRO-WASH) Awards are conducting a review of opportunities and challenges for incorporating resilient agriculture, alternative livelihoods, natural resource management (NRM), and WASH in emergency, early recovery, and development contexts. Given your expertise in these areas, we would greatly appreciate your input on this survey. The survey consists of a dozen questions, and should take no more than 20 minutes of your time.  This survey forms a critical part of the consultation process to inform and influence SCALE and PRO-WASH priorities and engagement for USAID Development Food Security Activities (DFSA), Emergency Food Security Programs (EFSP), and other emergency food security initiatives. Your responses will be kept confidential. Thank you in advance for your time and insights. The SCALE and PRO-WASH Teams
