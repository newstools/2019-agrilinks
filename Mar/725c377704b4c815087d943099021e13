The Food Safety Network (FSN) is seeking input on how to prioritize research on animal health issues in Feed the Future target countries. Please share your views by completing this survey by Friday, March 29.  The survey is open to anyone with experiences or opinions to share and is anonymous. FSN is an inter-agency agreement between USAID, USDA and FDA focused on strengthening the capacity of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) systems in focus countries by targeting a broad range of food safety measures, including those that lead to compliance with internationally accepted and science-based food safety standards. Food safety can be threatened at each step of an agricultural value chain, from production to consumption. An improved and increased capacity in food safety systems and approaches will result in food products that meet regional and international market and trade standards as well as demand for safe home consumption. One of our activities is to develop a livestock food safety distance learning module that provides important information to staff working with livestock value chains who may be neither livestock nor food safety experts. This hands-on interactive learning tool will be designed specifically to address the issues you may face on these topics. Thanks for your valuable input! The FSN Team
