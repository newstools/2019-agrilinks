The Feed the Future Advancing Women’s Empowerment (AWE) Program enhances women’s empowerment and gender equality in agricultural systems and programs by providing technical assistance to missions, implementing partners, the Bureau for Food Security, and USAID offices to increase women’s participation, productivity, profit, and benefit in agricultural systems. Our approach values co-design, participation, quality, and actionable leave-behinds.
