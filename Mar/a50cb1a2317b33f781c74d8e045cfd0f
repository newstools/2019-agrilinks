In Niger, two destructive pests, the pearl millet head miner and the pearl millet stem borer, can cause up to 85 percent yield loss of millet -- a deadly problem in a food-insecure country where millet is the most important staple crop. To fight the pearl millet head miner, the IPM Innovation Lab, in collaboration with ICRISAT-Niger and INRAN-Maradi, received a sub-award from the Sorghum and Millet Innovation Lab at Kansas State University to work on biological control of the pest. Below, a how-to video highlights the promising use of natural enemies to fight the devastating millet head miner. This factsheet provides more background on the project.
