Over the past five years, the USAID/Rwanda Private Sector Driven Agricultural Growth project (PSDAG), has explored, developed, and refined its multi-pronged approaches to helping increase smallholder incomes by promoting private sector investment in Rwanda. Through this five-part learning series, we will share some of our key thinking, processes, and lessons learned related to Cooperative Professionalization, Access to Finance, Social Inclusion, Business Development Services, and Public-Private Dialogue. We hope that donors, governments, and partners will find these learnings useful as they design and implement their own efforts moving forward. Cooperative Professionalization Cooperatives are an important resource for both farmers and off-takers when it comes to extension information, aggregation, access to services, and more. But many cooperatives are financially unsustainable or underperform due to poor management. Through PSDAG, USAID has designed and implemented a comprehensive set of efforts around cooperative professionalization that included business development services (BDS), quality management services (QMS), data utilization, digitization, and complementary activities. The attached PSDAG Learning Brief highlights the key takeaways from our November 2018 convening of more than 100 stakeholders in Kigali, Rwanda, and summarizes PSDAGâ€™s approach to professionalizing cooperatives, its challenges, and its results.
