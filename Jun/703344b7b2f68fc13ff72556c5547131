This month the Agrilinks team is focusing on connecting with and calling out contributions from the Agrilinks community, from USAID/Washington and Missions to implementing partners and a range of public and private food security stakeholders. One of our objectives is to highlight ways the community can contribute to Agrilinks to share learning, opportunities, publications, events, and other information related to food security and agriculture, resilience, nutrition, and water. Throughout the month we’ll feature “how-tos” for different elements of the site and how you can contribute and engage. Another objective of this month’s theme is to gather input and feedback from the Agrilinks community. As the team behind Agrilinks continues to evolve — at USAID and on the Feed the Future Knowledge, Data, Learning and Training project — we want to hear from you about topics, themes, and information that you want to hear about and engage around in the coming months. Please take our 5-minute survey here to start sharing feedback on how you currently use Agrilinks and topics you’d like to engage around. During this month, we’ll also highlight contributions from partners on the way that they have collaborated with Agrilinks in the past to share learning and engage a wider audience with their work. We want to hear how Agrilinks has supported your work. If you have time to write a full post, we’d love to hear your story. Don’t have time for a full post, but have a couple good bullet points? Share those with us here and we’ll be summarizing them and calling them out through a few different formats over the course of the month. We invite you to submit a post or feel free to share ideas, feedback, or questions with us at agrilinks@agrilinks.org (link sends e-mail).
