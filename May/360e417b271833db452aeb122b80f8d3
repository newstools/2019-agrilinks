This post was written by Stephan Hardeman, and originally appeared on Climatelinks. This month, Climatelinks is featuring geospatial tools and analysis. When it comes to climate change, geospatial tools and analysis provide innovative methods of visualizing drivers, threats and impacts. Emerging trends can also be identified and studied through geospatial analysis, which in turn allows for more strategic positioning of resources. Open-source mapping and visualization, such as what is offered by the Global Forest Watch tool, empower individuals to make an impact. Data journalism tools, such as Esri’s Story Maps, create an opportunity to tell the story of climate change and other environmental challenges in a unique and compelling way. Geospatial analysis and Earth observations are becoming ever more important as USAID makes strides towards the creation of a data-driven culture. New requirements for the collection of ‘activity location data’ aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of development programming while also fulfilling accountability and transparency objectives. Through initiatives like the GeoCenter, which is part of the U.S Global Development Lab, specialized analytical support for landscape analysis, and a growing network of geospatial specialists, USAID is building the capacity of its missions and encouraging the inclusion of geographic considerations in decision-making and scenario planning. Below are some of the projects, resources and blogs that you can currently find on Climatelinks: Projects Blogs Resources
