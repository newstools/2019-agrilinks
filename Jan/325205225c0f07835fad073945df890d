As a huge, diverse, and global implementer, one of CARE's biggest challenges is how we scale our learning to get more people engaged. Our project teams are doing wonderful work and constantly learning and improving their work based on what they learned. Sadly, that learning often stays with the project team itself, and doesn't reach other people who could really benefit from it. Our teams are always producing reports, and we do rigorous evaluations for almost all of our projects, but the messages don't always get through. We've been tracking what works and what doesn't to help us do better knowledge management partly by producing more useable knowledge. CARE just developed a set of #KMRules — actionable steps for staff to take what they have learned and share it in ways others can act on. These are based on five years of learning and experimenting about what action steps really work so people can access the information they need. They also draw from great resources that KDAD, TOPS and other USAID-funded networks have hosted over the years. I was really excited to see Agrilinks' call for posts on what we've learned about Knowledge Management, because this consolidated set of action steps has been helpful for us. Our West Africa offices were so interested that they translated them into French so they could have more conversations about it. We'd love feedback on these rules. Do they make sense in your context? What would you add?
