This month, Agrilinks is focusing on approaches to knowledge sharing and learning, and we want to hear from you. What resources and best practices have you found most useful in your work? If your program has a knowledge management component, what has been most successful? Have you tried an approach that failed? We want to hear about that too! In the meantime, here are a few resources to kickstart your knowledge-exchange efforts for 2019: The Art of Knowledge Exchange: A Results-Focused Planning Guide for Development Practitioners is a comprehensive step-by-step guide to peer-to-peer learning from the World Bank, including real-world case studies from a variety of development contexts. Also from the World Bank Group, Becoming a Knowledge-Sharing Organization: A Handbook for Scaling up Solutions through Knowledge Capturing and Sharing is a systematic guide to building a learning and knowledge-sharing organization from the ground up, from budgeting to M&E. Conferences and meetings are often among the biggest investments an organization may make in knowledge-sharing. This guide to Designing Participatory Meetings and Brown Bags from the TOPS Group has creative ideas to enrich your next gathering. Measuring and assessing the success of a knowledge management initiative can be tricky. The Guide to Monitoring and Evaluating Knowledge Management in Global Health Programs is a rich resource for anyone in this field, with insights and tools applicable to contexts beyond the health sector.Reach out to agrilinks@agrilinks.org if you're interested in contributing to this month's theme on Approaches to Knowledge Sharing and Learning or just have a good resource to share to this starter list!
