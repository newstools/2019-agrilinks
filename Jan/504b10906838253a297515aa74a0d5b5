The Mali trade scorecard compiles publicly available and regularly updated data related to four key trade determinants that are actionable at the national level, including: (1) production capacity, (2) the cost of trade, (3) institutional efficiency, and (4) trade policies. Scores are individually evaluated and compared to sub-Saharan African country peers. The indicators align with determinants identified in the Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support Systemâ€™s (ReSAKSS) 2018 Africa Agriculture Trade Monitor report and are described in the Intra-African Agriculture Trade Improvement Scorecards Indicator Summary.
