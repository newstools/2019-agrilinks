The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems at the University of Florida welcomes your poster abstract submission for the third Global Nutrition Symposium, to be held in Nepal, April 25-26, 2019. Submissions are due by January 31, and full instructions are available on our website. At this event, the poster session will share current research and knowledge on nutrition-sensitive livestock systems research and extension activities, with an emphasis on the regions of West Africa, East Africa and Asia. This yearâ€™s theme for the Symposium is "Extending Our Reach: Linking research to extension to improve livestock productivity, human nutrition and incomes." This Symposium will bring together ministers of agriculture and livestock production, livestock and nutrition researchers, top university administrators, educators and policy-makers. It will cover how the production and consumption of nutritious animal-source foods (ASF) can result in improved nutrition, health, incomes, and livelihoods, especially for vulnerable women and children. At this time, funding for attendance to the Symposium is not available.
