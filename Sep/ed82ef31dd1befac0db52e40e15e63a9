Complementary Foods for Africa (ComFA) is a tasty, affordable complementary food that can be made in households from local, readily available ingredients throughout Sub-Saharan Africa – soy flour, orange-fleshed sweet potato, fish powder and oil. ComFA is an excellent option for mothers introducing table foods to babies ranging from 6 months to 2 years old. Children love ComFA because of the natural sweetness from the sweet potato, and moms love it because it is easy to make and rich in protein and Vitamin A!
