Feed the Future, the U.S. governmentâ€™s global hunger and food security initiative, supports research that is critical to meeting the goals of producing more food with less land and water, improving nutrition, and increasing the resilience of families who rely on agriculture for a living. The USAID Bureau for Food Security is a donor agency in this intiative and relies heavily on Feed the Future research partners to strengthen the connection between their research and the goals of Feed the Future. In order for research to yield the greatest possible benefits, research results must be taken up and utilized. Research programs are encouraged to actively undertake social media content marketing and thought leadership to increase the visibility of Feed the Future research findings and ensure the findings reach the right audiences. In the sidebar to the right, are some tips for Feed the Future research partners to CITE, PROMOTE, and TRACK research.
