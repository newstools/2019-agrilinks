An Agrilinks comment discussion, known as an “e-consultation” or “AskAg Chat” is a way Agrilinks members can interact with Agrilinks members and food security experts and gain new information. During Agrilinks e-consultations, food security experts lead discussions in the comment section of an Agrilinks post. Designated experts will typically pose a question as a comment, and Agrilinks members are encouraged respond to the posed questions and provide their perspective. Members can pose their own questions as well and interact with other participants by replying to their comments. See this example below, from this discussion on facilitating and financing agricultural technologies.
