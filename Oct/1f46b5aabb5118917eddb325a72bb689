This month marks the end of the USAID-funded Learning Community initiative, and with it, we’ve produced the Key Lessons from Private Sector Engagement. Building from four individual case studies, the document draws challenges and provides key factors for successful NGO/Company Collaboration.  “The partnerships laid out in the four case studies mark a success for company engagement with NGOs and research organizations. Pulling from NGO and company interviews, the case studies synthesize the characteristics of companies and NGOs who are best suited to collaborate, the value proposition of partnership and the enabling factors for success.” You can read the key learnings including private sector examples of success here.  Individual case studies are also available here:  COFFEE SECTOR CLIMATE-SMART AWARENESS AND DECISION-MAKING COCOA SECTOR CLIMATE-SMART AWARENESS AND DECISION-MAKING GRAIN SECTOR CLIMATE-SMART AWARENESS AND DECISION-MAKING HELPING COCOA FARMERS TO ACHIEVE A LIVING INCOME AND ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE
