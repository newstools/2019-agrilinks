This toolkit, funded by the USAID Bureau for Africa and produced by FHI360, is designed to help projects, organizations and individuals who want to use low-cost video in their development projects. The toolkit does not assume that video is always the most appropriate solution for capturing and disseminating all types of information. Rather, given the growing accessibility of low-cost digital video cameras, video-enabled mobile phones and editing software, this toolkit aims to enable readers to develop a more systematic approach to using low-cost video as one medium through which they share and capture information.
