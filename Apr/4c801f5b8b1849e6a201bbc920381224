USAID’s Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment (E3) Office of Forestry and Biodiversity is now accepting submissions for a case study competition on biodiversity integration across USAID’s portfolio. The submission deadline is May 3, 2019. Cases may include biodiversity programming with multiple sector outcomes, as well as food security and other development programming with biodiversity outcomes. For example, investments in sustainably managed fisheries contribute to positive outcomes in nutrition, income generation and biodiversity. In addition to successes, case studies are welcome to discuss challenges in design, implementation or monitoring of integration. Integration of biodiversity conservation with other sectors has the potential to increase sustainability of development programming, amplify results and promote cost-savings. Integrated programming offers an opportunity to advance learning and an evidence-based approach, to identify lessons learned and to capture best practices. This case study competition seeks to understand and capture field-level learning on biodiversity integration into USAID programming across sectors. By entering the competition, your case study will help broaden knowledge and evidence on biodiversity integration both within and outside of USAID.
