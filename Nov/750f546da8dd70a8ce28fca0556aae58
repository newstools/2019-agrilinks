This video summarizes the presentations and themes of the first Global Nutrition Symposium, hosted by the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems.  Well-nourished populations, especially women and children, are the central focus of efforts to nurture development and thereby sustainably reduce global hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. Founded in 2017, the annual Global Nutrition Symposium as one of two premier multi-stakeholder knowledge sharing platforms for participatory priority development, dialogue, and research to development linkages. Each year the event is held in a different country with a focus on increasing production and consumption of animal-source foods to improve nutrition, health, and incomes. The symposium gathers ministers, policy-makers, researchers, public and private sector extension workers, producer organizations, and university administrators to discuss the global relevance of bridging research to extension and agriculture to nutrition linkages for improving human nutrition and livestock production. Key observations that shaped the 2019 symposium include: Recommended action points to shaping the future of nutritional development include: More details about the symposium, including links to presentations and posters, are available online here: livestocklab.ifas.ufl.edu/events/2019-global-nutrition-symposium/.
