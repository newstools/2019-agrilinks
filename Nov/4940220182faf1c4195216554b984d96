The purpose of this Addendum is to allow USAID/BFS/ARP to develop and implement a global program of agricultural biotechnology activities consistent with the purpose and objectives described in the overarching Agricultural Biotechnology APS, as well as the geographic and technical scope indicated in this Addendum. To accomplish this, the Addendum establishes a co-creation process whereby USAID seeks extensive communication with prospective partners in order to jointly explore and define key challenges and problems, identify new and existing solutions, build consensus around areas for action, and/or refine plans to move forward with programs, projects, and activities pertaining to agricultural biotechnology. Activities developed under this Addendum (#1) will conform to the Purpose, Theory of Change and Program Objectives described in the overarching Agricultural Biotechnology APS (7200AA20APS00003). USAID/BFS/ARP anticipates supporting multiple awards under this Addendum, with a tentative combined value of up to $70-100 million over an award period of up to five years.
