For mothers who want to raise healthy children, the issue of nutrition is paramount. Yet many remain unaware of which foods promote nutritional benefits.Â  Not all foods are created equal. In communities where subsistence farmers raise much of what they eat, how much emphasis should be placed on consuming milk and other animal-source foods? How much potential does it have to improve nutritional status? Join our panel of experts for a discussion about the challenges and benefits of animal-source foods. In this live webinar, you will hear perspectives about human nutrition, behavioral change, and livestock production, including sustainability issues. After a lively discussion, you will be able to ask questions of our experts. The webinar will focus on animal-source food and livestock being raised by smallholders in the developing world.
