This discussion will focus on research opportunities related to food safety, loss and waste. There is a need to better understand the dietary consequences of loss and waste of nutritious food and the effect of exposure to food safety issues that occur throughout the supply chain. Mitigation strategies for both loss and waste and food safety could take place anywhere along the supply chain, and are particularly needed in informal markets, where many of the nutritionally vulnerable source foods are found. We encourage you to actively engage by sharing your experience and thoughts on additional areas for research. Your engagement will inform USAID as it shapes its priorities for nutrition and food systems investments into the future. Click “Add New Comment” below to start or join the conversation.
