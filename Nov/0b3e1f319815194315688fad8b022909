The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock systems develops innovative solutions to problems with livestock production and animal-source food consumption. Here are four one-page fact sheets about innovations that were developed to support the improvement of feed resources and their utilization. Each innovation is based on active or recently completed research projects we funded in the respective country. They are widely applicable for smallholder farmers and stakeholders across the developing world. Each fact sheet provides a summary, quick facts, and an application of the innovation. These PDF pages may be printed or shared electronically. Management Entity. June 2019. Innovation Summary: Sorghum genotypes for livestock feeding.
