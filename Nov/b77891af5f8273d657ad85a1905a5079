Did you know that gender norms influence livestock systems, from production to consumption? This infographic presents information on the multiple women’s roles within livestock value chains, from provision of inputs into livestock production down to the stage of home consumption of livestock products. In addition to summary information for each value chain step, this infographic also includes country-specific examples and projects from the Livestock Systems Innovation Lab, and how they work to empower women in livestock value chains. For example, the “One Egg per Day” project in Burkina Faso researched the effects of recurrent nutrition training for mothers on the egg consumption by their young children. Other examples come from the countries of Nepal, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi. The aspects of the value chain emphasized are inputs, production, processing, marketing and consumption. Gender norms are a critical component to take into consideration in livestock research and development projects.
