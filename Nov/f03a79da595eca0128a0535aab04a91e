This discussion will focus on research opportunities related to gender, resilience and sustainability in the context of food security and nutrition.  Meaningful knowledge generation on agriculture and food systems for nutrition, requires agreement on indicators to measure each step of change, but in many areas these measurement tools are lacking and a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be measured remains an unfinished agenda.  Likewise, though we recognize that gender plays a central role within the food systems to nutrition pathway, there is a need to better understand the causal relationships within the pathways and how we can better leverage gender to facilitate strong agriculture-nutrition linkages. Finally, climate change and population growth are of paramount importance for resilience and sustainability of food systems and nutrition. We encourage you to actively engage by sharing your experience and thoughts on additional areas for research. Your engagement will inform USAID as it shapes its priorities for nutrition and food systems investments into the future. Click Add New Comment below to start or join the conversation.
