This discussion will focus on research opportunities related to agriculture-nutrition linkages at population scale. This topic spans the enabling environment for food systems. The evolving food systems of today are responding to policies, market dynamics, and how food prices influence the food environment. Further, the constraints related to poor market connectivity, limited processing and storage, and preservation options also influence access to relatively expensive perishable foods. From a consumer perspective, food prices, consumer income, beliefs, information, convenience, taste, and habits shape demand for nutritious foods and thereby shape the markets for entire populations. We encourage you to actively engage by sharing your experience and thoughts on additional areas for research. Your engagement will inform USAID as it shapes its priorities for nutrition and food systems investments in the future. Click “Add New Comment” below to start or join the conversation.
