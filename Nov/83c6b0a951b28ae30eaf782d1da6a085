A drafted peer-reviewed summary of current research on sustainability and global food and nutrition security issues was shared at the meeting of the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock, held in Kansas in September 2019. It provides insights into several major issues and existing evidence related to livestock and animal-source foods. The white paper’s six authors are eminent scientists from the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems and two universities, the University of Florida and Kansas State University. Lead author Dr. Geoffrey Dahl from the University of Florida was also a plenary speaker at the meeting. The paper, Animal source foods: contributions to food and nutrition security, is one of four background papers on sustainability domains shared with participants of the Multi-Stakeholder Partnership Meeting. The draft is available from the meeting’s website under a link for Food and nutrition security. The paper discusses food security in the context of human nutrition and a UNICEF framework for malnutrition. It covers definitions, threats, societal norms, and environmental issues related to livestock production and animal-source foods. Childhood development is a particular concern, and two figures provide a global context for stunting. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications for nutritional security. An updated version of the paper is expected for publication in 2020. Citation: Dahl, G., Hendrickx, S., Adesogan, A.T., Havelaar, A.H., McKune, S.L., and Vipham, J. 2019.
